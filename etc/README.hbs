Kerberos
========
The `kerberos` package is a C++ extension for Node.js that provides cross-platform support for kerberos authentication
using GSSAPI on linux/osx, and SSPI on windows. Much of the code in this module is adapted from
[ccs-kerberos](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pykerberos) and [winkerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/winkerberos).

### Requirements

**Linux**
- `python` v2.7
- `make`
- A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- Distribution-specific kerberos packages (e.g. `krb5-dev` on Ubuntu)

**macOS**
- `Xcode Command Line Tools`: Can be installed with `xcode-select --install`
- Distribution-specific kerberos packages (e.g. `krb5` on Homebrew)

**Windows**
- **Option 1:** Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's
[windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) by running `npm install -g
windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell (run as Administrator).
- **Option 2:** Install dependencies and configuration manually
1. Visual C++ Build Environment:
* **Option 1:** Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126) using the *Default
Install* option.
* **Option 2:** Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or
modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup.

> :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework
4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)

2. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Miniconda 2.7](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
(`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7`
3. Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

### MongoDB Node.js Driver Version Compatibility

Only the following version combinations with the [MongoDB Node.js
Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) are considered stable.

|               | `kerberos@1.x` | `kerberos@2.x` | `kerberos@7.x` |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `mongodb@7.x` | N/A            | N/A            | ✓              |
| `mongodb@6.x` | N/A            | ✓              | N/A            |
| `mongodb@5.x` | ✓              | ✓              | N/A            |
| `mongodb@4.x` | ✓              | ✓              | N/A            |
| `mongodb@3.x` | ✓              | N/A            | N/A            |

### Installation

Now you can install `kerberos` with the following:

```bash
npm install kerberos
```

#### Prebuild Platforms

Below are the platforms that are available as prebuilds on each github release.
`prebuild-install` downloads these automatically depending on the platform you are running npm install on.

- Linux GLIBC 2.28 or later
- s390x
- arm64
- x64
- MacOS universal binary
- x64
- arm64
- Windows
- x64

### Release Integrity

Releases are created automatically and signed using the [Node team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/node-driver.asc).
This applies to the git tag as well as all release packages provided as part of a GitHub release. To verify the provided
packages, download the key and import it using gpg:

```
gpg --import node-driver.asc
```

The GitHub release contains a detached signature file for the NPM package (named
`kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig`).

The following command returns the link npm package.
```shell
npm view kerberos@vX.Y.Z dist.tarball
```

Using the result of the above command, a `curl` command can return the official npm package for the release.

To verify the integrity of the downloaded package, run the following command:
```shell
gpg --verify kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

>[!Note]
No verification is done when using npm to install the package. To ensure release integrity when using npm, download the
tarball manually from the GitHub release, verify the signature, then install the package from the downloaded tarball
using npm install mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.

To verify the native `.node` packages, follow the same steps as above.

### Testing

Run the test suite using:

```bash
docker run -i -v PATH_TO_KERBEROS_REPO:/app -w /app -e PROJECT_DIRECTORY=/app ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash
/app/.evergreen/run-tests-ubuntu.sh
```

NOTE: The test suite requires an active kerberos deployment.
